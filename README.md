# Hint of Green
Jellyfin CSS Theme for Cinecraft

"Hint of Green" ported to Cinecraft

## Features
- Colors are based on a popular template
- Little sprinkle of green everywhere, but never too much
- Lighter theme for video playback (better if you see for yourself)
- Disabled blurring on Safari (browser performance issues)
- Better support for mobile devices
- Works extremely beautiful with backdrop enabled
- Some playful coloring at unexpected places (you will like it)

This theme can be considered as heavy, but of course there some css will disable by itself if certain unfavorable conditions are met.

## Installation
There will be two channels, one stable and one nightly. It is always ideal to use the stable version if you are deploying to a large amount of people. But if you like to be risky, feel free to use the nightly version. I will merge nightly into stable once I feel the nightly version is performing well enough.
Copy this code into Dashboard > General > Custom CSS
#### Stable:
```css
@import url('https://ld3z.github.io/CinecraftCSS/theme.css');
```
or
#### Tester/Nightly:
```css
@import url('https://ld3z.github.io/CinecraftCSS/themeNightly.css');
```

## To enable fanart/logo
- Install the Fanart plugin first
- Go to Dashboard > Library
- For each library you have, go to Manage Library
- Enable Fanart for image fetcher
- Then go to Fetcher Settings and select "Logo"
- Manually scan media library
- Refresh the page once done

## Nginx
If you are using nginx as a reverse proxy for Jellyfin, replace the "add_header Content-Security-Policy" in your nginx config with this line below
```
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src https: data: blob: http://image.tmdb.org; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://looi-wh.github.io ; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.gstatic.com/cv/js/sender/v1/cast_sender.js https://www.youtube.com blob:; worker-src 'self' blob:; connect-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'self'";
```
